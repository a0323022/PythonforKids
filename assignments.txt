Done - 2/19/20 - Homework	Watch 1. Course Overview
	2. Introduction
	3. The Rules of Programming Languages
Notes	• Good Pseudocode yields good program
	        • Break things down into manageable, programmable pieces.
	• Whitespaces is important
	        • Python pays attention to spaces, tabs, etc.
	• Comments - if you have to explain what it's doing, then it is too complicated
	• Common comments - Todo, fixme, hack
	• Book - Python for Kids

Done - 3/18/20	3 Programming assignments
Done - 4/8/20	1. Core Python: Modularity
	Watch Video Core Python: Getting Started - Modularity 21:22
	Solve the following problems in VS Code (folder: if-statements)
	 
	#1: Twinkies!
	Create an if statement that checks whether a number of Twinkies (in the variable twinkies) is less than 100 or greater than 500. Your program should print the message “Too few or too many” if the condition is true.
	 
	#2: Just the Right Number
	Create an if statement that checks whether the amount of money contained in the variable money is between 100 and 500 or between 1,000 and 5,000.
	 
	#3: I Can Fight Those Ninjas
	Create an if statement that prints the string “That’s too many” if the variable ninjas contains a number that’s less than 50, prints “It’ll be a struggle, but I can take ’em” if it’s less than 30, and prints “I can fight those ninjas!” if it’s less than 10. 
	
4/15/20	4/15 Homework
	-------------------------
	#1: Even Numbers
	Create a loop that prints even numbers until it reaches your year of age or, if your age is an odd number, prints out odd numbers until it reaches your age. 
	 
	#2: Your Weight on the Moon
	If you were standing on the moon right now, your weight would be 16.5 percent of what it is on Earth. You can calculate that by multiplying your Earth weight by 0.165. If you gained a kilo in weight every year for the next 15 years, what would your weight be when you visited the moon each year and at the end of the 15 years? Write a program using a for loop that prints your moon weight for each year.
	 
	#3: My Five Favorite Ingredients
	Create a list containing five different sandwich ingredients, such as the following:
	>>> ingredients = ['snails', 'leeches', 'gorilla belly-button lint','caterpillar eyebrows', 'centipede toes'] 
	Now create a loop that prints out the list (including the numbers): Solve this one twice; once with a for loop and once with a while loop
	 
	No videos this week. Next week we will cover functions and modules as a group than watch a few more videos.
